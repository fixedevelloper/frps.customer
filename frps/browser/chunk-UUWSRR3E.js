They help simulate the appearance and functionality of a real FAQ section without requiring actual content."},{question:"Are Dummy FAQs suitable for customer support purposes?",answer:"While Dummy FAQs can be used internally for training customer support teams, they are not suitable for public-facing customer support. Real FAQs should be based on genuine customer inquiries to provide accurate and helpful information."},{question:"Do Dummy FAQs require attribution?",answer:"No, Dummy FAQs do not require attribution since they are not based on real questions or contributed by individuals.
